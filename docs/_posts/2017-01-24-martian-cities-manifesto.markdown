## We are going to Mars.

Mars calls to us. We’ve sent mechanical ambassadors to map it, sample it, probe it, and send back mountains of data. We’re each fascinated by Mars for our own reasons – scientific exploration, a new frontier, a fresh start, a staging ground for the solar system and beyond – but we share a common desire to go there in person.

It’s no longer a question of whether the people of Earth will send humans to Mars; just a question of who will go first and how soon we can send them. 

## We will go to stay.

Transporting anything from Earth to Mars is a long, difficult, and expensive process. Sending building materials, supplies, food, or even people there only makes sense as a one-way trip, and is best sustained by using in-situ resources. Our home there can’t be a base camp; it will need to be permanent and continuously supported. 

## We take our humanity with us.

We’re human beings from Earth. That doesn’t stop when we reach Mars; we’ll live in homes, eat food, laugh at silly things, love our pets. We’ll sing and build and teach and learn and fight and break and rebuild just like people have for thousands of years. We’ll just be on Mars when we do it.

Human beings have a particular biology, patterns of cognition, methods of language, and commonalities of culture. Our homes on Mars will need to make room for an entire ecology, a nurturing noosphere, a space for all of us to live as complete human beings.

## There will be thousands of us.

Plans are already underway to send hundreds of people to Mars at a time, driving toward a population of at least a million . It’ll be a big start, and Mars will be home to thousands of us sooner rather than later. The population will grow in larger and larger waves, reach requiring the people of the previous waves to not only survive but to be ready to absorb thousands more without destroying what they’ve built so far.

This is a fundamental shift from the outposts we’ve known both on earth and in space, built up slowly and supported by a massive effort from their home civilizations. The settlements of Mars will look very different from bases in Antarctica or stations in low Earth orbit.

## Mars has all we need to live.

Mars has water, sunlight, metals, and all the components necessary to sustain life. Not a lot of any of them, and not pre-assembled for our convenience, but enough. Mars has a day-night cycle about as long as Earth’s, enough surface gravity to support our health,  We can do the work to make Mars fertile and independent, bringing only what we need to start from Earth.

Better yet, Mars is home to enough natural beauty to explore for lifetimes. Mile-high canyons with sheer cliffs, ancient streambeds, enormous mountains, and layer-cake ice caps have never been seen before by living eyes, and we have no idea what wonders we’ll find under the surface. The inhabitants of Mars will be spoiled for natural beauty. 

## Living on Mars will be a unique challenge.

The atmosphere is a near-vacuum. There is no planetary magnetic field to shield us from solar or cosmic radiation. The water is mostly underground, probably frozen, and likely contaminated. There are no plants on Mars, no lakes, no streams. Yet.

Our entire ecosystem will need to be built up from what Mars does provide, and we’ll need to do so in a way that we can sustain for centuries to come, without destroying our new home. It will be the biggest challenge humans have ever faced.

## We need to work together.

It will take thousands of us, millions, working together as best we can to meet this challenge, even though we each have different goals for our lives on Mars. We won’t have much room for error, and even with thousands we can be wiped out far too easily. We won’t be able to afford excluding anyone based on race, gender, orientation, cultural history, religion, or philosophy. On the contrary, diversity and inclusion will be fundamental to how we work together, even as we accept each other’s differences and desires for independence.

## Humanity thrives in cities.

Humans have built cities for thousands of years, and more people live in cities now than ever. Cities are where we keep our infrastructure, our art, and our permanent legacy. Cities provide us with independence, sustainability, efficiency, opportunity, and culture. On Mars, with so few of us facing so many dangers, we’ll need to build our settlements and organize ourselves with an eye toward all the patterns that make cities effective over the centuries.

## Livable cities require continuous, human-centered design.

A city isn’t a slab on which we build machines for shipping people and stuff around. It’s more like an organism that produces and distributes food, energy, and information; that cycles waste for sustainable reuse;  that connects people to each other and expresses the geography around them; that protects people from the vagaries of nature and the natural environment from the vagaries of people. 

Cities aren’t designed as a whole, laid down ready for people to move in and live happily. History is littered with failed experiments, cities designed from scratch to overcome the messy past that become empty shells because they’re missing vital parts of human life or culture. Cities don’t emerge naturally from individual activity, either; laying down house after house and business after business won’t automatically result in a self-sustaining city once it hits a certain scale. A welcoming, livable city is the result of ongoing collaboration and revision, shaped both by small-scale personal expression and common principles shared among the people who live there.

## Designing Martian cities begins now.

Even before the first footprint on Martian soil, we can start collecting patterns, designs, and ideas to share with the people who will build Martian cities. We can get to know the environment that Mars will present us, the patterns that Earth cities show us already, the tools we’ll have at our disposal, and the principles we’ll use to apply the best of our world to life on a new one. 

We also have the opportunity to build (or rebuild) cities on Earth using these same principles, either as specific analogs for the Martian environment, or as answers to the many environmental and social challenges people already face on Earth. What we learn on Mars doesn’t have to stay there, and what we learn on Earth won’t be limited to ideas and designs.

## This is where we start. Let’s build Martian cities!
